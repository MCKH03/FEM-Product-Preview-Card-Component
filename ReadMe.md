# FEM-Product-Preview-Card-Component

Hi everyone. I did this project and also learnt some new techniques during the way of bulding it. In this markdown I want to tell some of my issues when bulding it and also the things that I learned from building this.

## Things that I learned:

1- Some responsive techniques and the problems that would occur if
we don't use those techniques!

2- Overall it was an easy one!

## The problems that I encountered:

1- Actually, I didn't really face any special problem.

## Conclusion:

Anyhow, I think my design was pretty close to what it is in frontend mentor. I hope you liked it too and I really appreciate your comments on the way I coded it.
